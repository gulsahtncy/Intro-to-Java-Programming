	 * Can you convert a for loop to a while loop? List the advantages of using for

	// for loop can be converted into a while loop.

	// Some benefits of for loops are:

	// A for certain type of problem, a for loop can be easier to construct and easier to read than the corresponding while loop.
	// It is a very good (perhaps the best) choice for counting loops.
	// All the control variables are nicely collected into one place when using for loops.
