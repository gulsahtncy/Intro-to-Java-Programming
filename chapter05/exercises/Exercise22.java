	/*The code will not compile if we remove the cast. 
	 * This is because the code is semi dangerous since information might be 
	 * lost when we convert an int to a char. An int can hold a wider range of 
	 * numbers than a char.
	 */
	
	/*But no information will be lost in this case because the numbers are 
	 * always small enough to fit in a char.

	/*So there is no problem with our code but we still need to make a cast 
	 * to a char to indicate to compiler that we are aware of what we are doing.
