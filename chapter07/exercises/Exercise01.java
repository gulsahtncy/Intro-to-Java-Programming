	 * An array reference variable is declared by the use of brackets. For example,
	 * the following code declares a variable myList that references an array of
	 * double elements: double[] myList;

	/*
	 * An array reference variable is used as a handle to access the content of the
	 * array, but just creating this variable will not allocate any space in memory
	 * for the array. Memory for the array is allocated by using the keyword new. If
	 * we need to be able to store 10 doubles so shall we write like in the
	 * following code: myList = new double[10];
	 */

	/*
	 * If we know the values that shall go in the array before it is created so is
	 * it also possible to use a shorthand notation. This is called an array
	 * initializer that will allocate memory and create the array reference:
	 * double[] myList = {1.9, 2.4, 3.4, 3.5, 1.0, 5.7, 3.1, 1.1, 8.7, 4.6};
